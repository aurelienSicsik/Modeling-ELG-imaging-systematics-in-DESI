# Modeling-ELG-imaging-systematics-in-DESI

This github repositery contains the python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that compose my work during my internship at the LBNL. It consisted in creating a simple forward-modeling Monte-Carlo simulation to model the effect of imaging systematics on the Emission Line Galaxy (ELG) target selection of DESI. The code can be run on NERSC with the DESI environment.
